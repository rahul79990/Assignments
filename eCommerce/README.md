## Client Interaction
___
> The client, such as a web browser or a mobile app, sends HTTP requests to the server for ecommerce operations, including browsing products, adding items to the cart, placing orders, etc. (CRUD operations).

## Controller Layer
___
> In the Spring Boot application, the incoming HTTP requests are handled by the Controller layer. The Controller receives the requests and delegates them to the appropriate methods in the service layer.

## Service Layer
___
> The Service layer contains the business logic of the application and handles eCommerce operations. When a request is received from the Controller, the Service layer performs the necessary actions. For example, when creating a new product or address etc. The Service layer validates the input data, generates a unique identifier, and interacts with the data access layer.

## Data Access Layer
___
> The Data Access layer is responsible for interacting with the MySQL database to perform CRUD operations on the data. It uses SQL to map Java objects to database tables and execute SQL queries.

## Database
___
> The MySQL database stores ecommerce data, including product information, user details, orders, etc.

## Response
___
> After the data operation is completed, the response flows back through the layers in the reverse order. The Service layer receives the response from the Data Access layer, performs any necessary post-processing or formatting, and sends it back to the Controller.

## Controller Response
___
> The Controller layer receives the response from the Service layer and returns an appropriate HTTP response to the client, indicating the success or failure of the requested operation.




# Data Structure

## Product Model
> The Product model represents the data structure for storing product information. It typically includes attributes such as ID, name, description, price, etc.

## Order Model
> The Order model represents the data structure for storing order information. It typically includes attributes such as ID, user details, product details, total amount, etc.

## User Model
> The User model represents the data structure for storing user information. It typically includes attributes such as ID, name, email, address, etc.

## Address Model
> The Address model represents the data structure for storing address information. It typically includes attributes such as ID, street, city, state, postal code, etc.
