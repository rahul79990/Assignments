## Client Interaction
___
> The client, such as a web browser or a mobile app, sends HTTP requests to the server for employee and address search operations, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting students and events (CRUD operations).

## Controller Layer
___
> In the Spring Boot application, the incoming HTTP requests are handled by the Controller layer. The Controller receives the requests and delegates them to the appropriate methods in the service layer.

## Service Layer
___
> The Service layer contains the business logic of the application and handles employee and address operations. When a request is received from the Controller, the Service layer performs the necessary actions. For example, when creating a new employee or address, the Service layer validates the input data, generates a unique identifier, and interacts with the data access layer.

## Data Access Layer
___
> The Data Access layer is responsible for interacting with the underlying database to perform CRUD operations on the data. It uses Hibernate to map Java objects to database tables and execute SQL queries.

## Database
___
> The database stores the employee and address details data. It can be any relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2 or Swagger.

## Response
___
> After the data operation is completed, the response flows back through the layers in the reverse order. The Service layer receives the response from the Data Access layer, performs any necessary post-processing or formatting, and sends it back to the Controller.

## Controller Response
___
> The Controller layer receives the response from the Service layer and returns an appropriate HTTP response to the client, indicating the success or failure of the requested operation.
